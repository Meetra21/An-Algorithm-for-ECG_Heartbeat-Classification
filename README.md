# ECG Heartbeat Categorization with Deep Learning  

This project implements **deep neural network models** to classify heartbeats from **electrocardiogram (ECG) signals** into different categories of arrhythmia. The dataset combines signals from two well-known sources:  

- **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**  
- **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**  

The goal is to accurately identify abnormal heart rhythms and support the development of **computer-aided diagnosis systems** in cardiology.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal  

- Train a **deep learning model** to categorize ECG heartbeat signals.  
- Detect and classify arrhythmia types from ECG recordings.  
- Explore **transfer learning** for improving classification accuracy.  
- Provide insights into the most distinguishing features of ECG waveforms.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview  

### 1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**  
- 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel ECG recordings  
- 47 subjects (recorded between 1975â€“1979)  
- 109,446 heartbeat samples classified into **5 categories**:  
  - **N** â€“ Normal beats  
  - **S** â€“ Supraventricular ectopic beats  
  - **V** â€“ Ventricular ectopic beats  
  - **F** â€“ Fusion beats  
  - **Q** â€“ Unknown beats  

### 2. **PTB Diagnostic ECG Database**  
- ECG signals including normal and myocardial infarction cases  
- Used for **transfer learning experiments** and model generalization  

### ðŸ“Œ Key Notes  
- Each sample corresponds to a **single segmented heartbeat**.  
- Preprocessed and standardized for training deep neural networks.  
- Large enough for both **training and validation** of deep learning models.

## ðŸ§­ Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Load ECG signals and segment into heartbeat samples  
- Normalize amplitude values  
- Encode heartbeat categories (N, S, V, F, Q)  

### 2. Model Development  
- **Baseline Models**: CNN and LSTM for temporal signal classification  
- **Advanced Models**:  
  - Deep CNN for feature extraction  
  - Transfer learning across datasets (MIT-BIH â†’ PTB)  

### 3. Training & Evaluation  
- Train/test split  
- Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  

### 4. Interpretation  
- Visualize ECG signals with predicted labels  
- Compare predictions vs. ground truth
